# Getting Started Overview

Welcome to the ESP32-C3 Filter Wheel Controller project! This guide will walk you through everything needed to build and configure your own professional astronomy filter wheel.

## üìã What You'll Build

By following this guide, you'll create a fully functional filter wheel controller featuring:

- **Precision motor control** with configurable speeds and acceleration
- **Real-time OLED display** showing current filter and status
- **Magnetic encoder feedback** for accurate positioning
- **ASCOM compatibility** for seamless software integration
- **USB connectivity** with comprehensive serial command interface

## üõ£Ô∏è Build Process Overview

The complete build process involves these main phases:
